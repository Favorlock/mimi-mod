This SoundFont is bundled with MIMI to provide consistent sound across all platforms.

The GMGSx.SF2 SoundFont was created by Kenneth Rundt, the author of [SynthFont](http://www.synthfont.com/) and is provided via the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license (included).

The copy of the SoundFont provided by MIMI includes minor alterations from the original to remap some Presets to the same GM2 Bank-Patch values as used by the default Windows GM SoundFont. This was done to allow better support for custom SoundFonts in MIMI because the modified GM2 Bank-Patch values are more universally accepted as the standard for the Presets.

The original version of the GMGSx.SF2 SoundFont as created by Kenneth may be downloaded [here](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/841).

 &nbsp;
MIMI is a Forge mod for Minecraft Java Edition that allows you to play music from MIDI files, a MIDI Input Device, or just your keyboard using a variety of instruments either solo or with a group. The implementation is similar to the way that Rust instruments work and makes for a really easy to use yet powerful system.

- Craft and play 14 (and counting) different instruments
- Play up to 3 instruments at the same time by yourself
- Hear up to 16 instruments being played around you at the same time
- Load MIDI files from your system and play them using your instruments
- Use the MIDI Transmitter to broadcast MIDI notes to nearby instruments to play music with other players
- Connect a MIDI Input Device (like a digital piano) to your system and play instruments with it
- Load a SoundFont to replace the default system MIDI sounds with higher quality ones
- In-game documentation using Vazkii's Patchouli mod provides easy access to recipes, getting started guides, and detailed instructions.

## Minecraft Versions
MIMI is a mod that I am developing in my spare time and as such it will only be supporting a limited subset of Minecraft and Forge versions. When a new version is released it may take some time for the mod to be updated. Fabric and Rift are not supported and will not be supported by me, but if someone would like to port the mod to either of them that would be fine! The current versions that this mod officially supports are outlined below.

**Minecraft &lt; 1.16**: _Unsupported_

**Minecraft 1.16.x**: _Features & Fixes_

**Minecraft 1.17**: _Unsupported (until Forge 1.17 is ready)_
